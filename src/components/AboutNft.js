                  Doge Rush is the world's first P2E single-player mobile runner
                  game with NFT assets, Collectible coins have been a feature in
                  side-scrolling runners from the beginning; Sonic Dash had
                  rings, and Super Mario had coins. What if those coins were
                  real, bonafide currency? Doge Rush rewards you for every coin
                  you collect with the opportunity to pile up $DR coins for
                  in-game prizes and real-world cash.
                </span>
                <span>
                  In our groundbreaking P2E runner, every coin you collect
                  in-game goes right to your wallet at the end of the level. For
                  the first time, play a hilarious side-scrolling runner that’s
                  worth your time—literally.

                  You play as Doge. Your mission? Escape Elon Musk while dashing
                  through the derelict subways of a dystopian underworld. Yeah,
                  Doge Rush has serious meme potential.
                </span>
                <span>
                  Control Doge by swiping up, down, left, and right to collect
                  coins while you evade Elon’s clutches. As you progress through
                  the game, the pace grows faster; more obstacles get in your
                  way. The harder the game gets, the better your opportunity to
                  earn points, and as a result, more crypto.
                </span>
                <span>
                  Doge Rush has a variety of unique characters with upgradable
                  NFT skins, which differ in prices and est. ROI that players
                  will get. Upgrade your character to higher levels, fuse it
                  with another one to boost your earnings from playing, or sell
                  it to other players via the Doge Rush marketplace.
