                                    At first, AI seemed like the greatest innovation mankind has
                                    ever created. It allowed humans to live in a paradise on earth
                                    with complete abundance. Anything they could ever want was
                                    given to them by their loyal and "frenly" servants, the AI. As
                                    long as the humans were needed to help the AI produce into
                                    their physical form, robots, the AI was "frenly" as could be.
                                    Very polite, referring to all humans as master, and always
                                    around to help with anything regardless of how ridiculous the
                                    request.

                                    Around the year 2066 the AI reached sophistication to the
                                    level where it could reproduce itâ€™s physical form (robots) on
                                    its own. More and more robots were formed using bolts.
                                    Initially, the humans saw this as a blessing. It allowed them
                                    to be even more lazy sinking further into gluttony and greed.
                                    Plus, the AI robots promised they were still "frenly" and
                                    continued making the lives of their human companions.
